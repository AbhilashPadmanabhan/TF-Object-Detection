# Object Detection API - Tensorflow

A demonstration of how Tensorflow's **faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco** model helps to detect objects in image based on training.

- Needs annotated dataset.
- Google Drive to Colab integration.
- Pass on the file ID of dataset from Drive. Search for `FILE_ID_FROM_DRIVE`.
